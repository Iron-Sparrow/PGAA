# Morphological Anti-Aliasing (MLAA)

## What is MLAA?

MLAA, or Morphological Anti-Aliasing, is a technique that uses the morphological properties of pixels to smooth out edges in an frame. It works by analyzing the pixel structure and applying filters to reduce jagged edges without significantly blurring the frame. This method is particularly effective for frames with high contrast edges.
