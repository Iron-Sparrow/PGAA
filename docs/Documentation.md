## What is PGAA?

PGAA is a Python Package that provides multiple forms of anti-aliasing for [Pygame-CE surfaces](https://pyga.me/docs/ref/surface.html).

## Available Anti-Aliasing Methods

### SSAA (Super Sample Anti-Aliasing)
> [!TIP]
> SSAA was implemented as the first algorith and doesn't require Numpy to run.

> [!NOTE]
> It was added in **0.1.0**.

To check out the documentation for SSAA, see [SuperSampling.md](../docs/SuperSampling.md).
